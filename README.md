# 30Book
my first site... something like 30book.com (just for practice &amp; nothing else)
this is my first website designing just for practicing
i use basic html and css and jQuery for that
i am trying my best to make this website perfectly responsive so the main purpose why i'm doing this is:
1. get to know css and jQuery in real work
2. getting use to think about responsivity (is that a real word? :)) and build it smoother and faster <br>

i hope i reach my goals :)  <br>
